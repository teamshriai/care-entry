// Front Office Payments — a mock/in-memory billing and collection layer.
// This is deliberately NOT a finance/accounting system: one Payment record
// is one administrative bill (registration fee, consultation, a service
// charge, …), collected in one or more transactions, with an optional single
// refund. No real payment gateway, no card/bank/UPI credentials are ever
// held here — only the simulated RESULT of a collection.
